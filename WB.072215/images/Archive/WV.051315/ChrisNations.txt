Greg Goode spoke with Chris Nations, Indiana State University alumnus and president of the 

Nations Group. The group is based out of Scottsdale Arizona and has served as a consultant on 

the Hulman Center project. Nations worked for the ISU athletic department when he attended 

university. He kept that passion when founding The Nations Group, a firm that focuses on public 

finance and construction of athletics. The group works with many universities in updating their 

sports facilities, working also with Kansas City at the same time that they work with the Hulman 

Center in Terre Haute. Nations speaks about how the Hulman Center is being updated to reflect 

the other big changes ISU is making to its campus, what updates are being done, and why these 

changes are necessary.
